Welcome to **GitJournal Notes** — my digital brain dump powered by [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io).  
It’s part notebook, part chaos engine, and entirely too honest. This repo holds everything from world domination ideas to code snippets, random existential meltdowns, and notes that made too much sense to delete.

## What the Hell Is This?

Think of this as a **version-controlled diary for degenerates and geniuses alike.**  
Every note lives as a plain text Markdown file, synced, committed, and backed by Git — because I trust version control more than cloud services that randomly eat my data.

This repo may include:
- 📓 Daily logs, brain vomit, and late-night revelations  
- 💡 Project notes, design musings, and writing scraps  
- 🧩 Code snippets, shell tricks, and “why the hell did this work?” discoveries  
- 🔥 Random chaos that might one day become something cool
