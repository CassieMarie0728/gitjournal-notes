Welcome to **GitJournal Notes** — my digital brain dump powered by [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io).  
It’s part notebook, part chaos engine, and entirely too honest. This repo holds everything from world domination ideas to code snippets, random existential meltdowns, and notes that made too much sense to delete.

## What the Hell Is This?

Think of this as a **version-controlled diary for degenerates and geniuses alike.**  
Every note lives as a plain text Markdown file, synced, committed, and backed by Git — because I trust version control more than cloud services that randomly eat my data.

This repo may include:
- Daily logs, brain vomit, and late-night revelations  
- Project notes, design musings, and writing scraps  
- Code snippets, shell tricks, and “why the hell did this work?” discoveries  
- Random chaos that might one day become something cool

## Setup (Because Apparently You Want to Join the Madness)

1. **Install GitJournal**
   - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gitjournal.gitjournal)
   - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gitjournal/id1466519634)
   - Or just use your preferred Markdown editor + Git client like a barbarian.

2. **Clone This Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/GitJournal-Notes.git
   cd GitJournal-Notes

3. **Hook It Up in GitJournal**
   - Open the app → Settings → Git Repository
   - Enter your repo URL (SSH preferred if you hate passwords)
   - Enable auto-sync and bask in the glory of self-inflicted organization

4. **Optional – Use with Obsidian / VS Code**
   - Obsidian users: Just open this folder as a vault
   - VS Code users: Grab “Markdown All in One” + “GitLens” and pretend you’re hacking the Matrix

## Recommended Setup

**Tool**	                |         **Why You Should Care**
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) GitJournal	          |           Mobile sync & Markdown simplicity
2) VS Code	             |           Editing comfort + Git integration
3) Obsidian	             |           Graph-view wizardry for your chaos
4) GitHub	             |           Versioned chaos you can brag about
5) rclone / cronjob	    |           For backups because we’ve been hurt before

## Philosophy

*“If it isn’t in the repo, it doesn’t exist.”*

  - Commit early, commit often. Your future self will thank you (or curse you less).
  - Embrace the mess. Genius and madness are roommates here.
  - Markdown over mind rot.
  - Private repos exist for a reason. Don’t unleash your demons publicly by accident.

## Privacy Disclaimer

This repo may include:
  - Raw emotion and feral honesty
  - Ideas worth millions or worth arrest
  - Strong language and stronger opinions

If you find this repo: congratulations, you’ve trespassed into my mental garage.
Touch anything and you’ll get metaphorical grease on your soul.

## Contributing

**No.**
This is a one-person circus, not a community project.
Fork it, make your own chaos vault, and maybe tag me if you survive the experience.

## License

**WTFPL**
 —
Do whatever the fuck you want.
Just don’t pretend it was your idea first.

## Roadmap (a.k.a. things I might do eventually)

 - Automate daily note creation
 - Add Obsidian compatibility metadata
 - Build GitHub Action for auto-commit/sync
 - Add “random note of the day” script
 - Replace caffeine with intravenous Markdown (still in testing)

## Changelog

**v1.0 — Birth of Chaos**
 - Repo initialized
 - First batch of notes committed
 - Instant regret logged

## Final Words

This isn’t productivity.
It’s therapy — version controlled.
